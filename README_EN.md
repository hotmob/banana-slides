## ✨ Project Origin
Have you ever been in this predicament: a report is due tomorrow, but your PPT is still blank; you have countless brilliant ideas in your head, but all your passion is drained by tedious typesetting and design?

We long to quickly create presentations that are both professional and well-designed. While traditional AI PPT generation apps generally meet the "speed" requirement, they still face the following issues:

- 1️⃣ Only pre-set templates can be selected, with no flexibility to adjust styles.
- 2️⃣ Low freedom, making multi-round adjustments difficult.
- 3️⃣ The finished products look similar, leading to heavy homogenization.
- 4️⃣ Low material quality and lack of targeted content.
- 5️⃣ Disjointed text and image layout, with poor design sense.

These flaws make traditional AI PPT generators fail to satisfy the two major needs of "speed" and "beauty" simultaneously. Even those claiming to be "Vibe PPT" are far from being "Vibe" in my eyes.

However, the emergence of the nano banana🍌 model changed everything. I tried using 🍌pro for PPT page generation and found that the quality, aesthetics, and consistency were excellent. It can almost accurately render all the text required by the prompt and follow the style of reference images. So, why not build a native "Vibe PPT" application based on 🍌pro?

## 👨‍💻 Use Cases

1. **Beginners**: Quickly generate beautiful PPTs with zero barrier to entry, no design experience needed, and no template choice fatigue.
2. **PPT Professionals**: Get design inspiration quickly by referencing AI-generated layouts and combinations of text and graphic elements.
3. **Educators**: Rapidly convert teaching content into illustrated lesson plan PPTs to enhance classroom effectiveness.
4. **Students**: Quickly complete assignment presentations and focus energy on content rather than typesetting and beautification.
5. **Business Professionals**: Rapidly visualize business proposals and product introductions, with quick adaptation to multiple scenarios.

## 🎯 Features

### 1. Flexible Creation Paths
Supports **Idea**, **Outline**, and **Page Description** as three starting points to meet different creative habits.
- **One-sentence generation**: Input a topic, and AI automatically generates a clear outline and page-by-page content descriptions.
- **Natural language editing**: Supports "Vibe" style verbal modifications to outlines or descriptions (e.g., "Change page three to a case study"), with real-time AI responses.
- **Outline/Description Mode**: Allows both one-click batch generation and manual detail adjustment.

<img width="2000" height="1125" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fc1ecc6-433d-4157-b4ca-95fcebac66ba" />


### 2. Powerful Material Parsing
- **Multi-format support**: Upload PDF/Docx/MD/Txt files, and the background automatically parses the content.
- **Intelligent extraction**: Automatically identifies key points, image links, and chart information from text to provide rich materials for generation.
- **Style reference**: Supports uploading reference images or templates to customize the PPT style.

<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="File parsing and material processing" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8cda1fd2-2369-4028-b310-ea6604183936" />

...
```

**Configuration for the new editable export method**: Create an application on the [Baidu AI Cloud Platform](https://console.bce.baidu.com/ai-engine/ocr/overview/index?type=1) to obtain an API KEY, and fill it into the `BAIDU_OCR_API_KEY` field in the `.env` file (there is a generous free tier).


<details>
  <summary>📒 Using Vertex AI (GCP Free Credits)</summary>

If you want to use Google Cloud Vertex AI (available via GCP new user credits), additional configuration is required:

1. Create a service account in the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and download the JSON key file.
2. Rename the key file to `gcp-service-account.json` and place it in the project root directory.
3. Edit the `.env` file:
   ```env
   AI_PROVIDER_FORMAT=vertex
   VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
   VERTEX_LOCATION=global
   ```
4. Edit `docker-compose.yml` and uncomment the following:
   ```yaml
   # environment:
   #   - GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/app/gcp-service-account.json
   # ...
   # - ./gcp-service-account.json:/app/gcp-service-account.json:ro
   ```

> **Note**: `gemini-3-*` series models require `VERTEX_LOCATION=global`.

</details>

**FAQ**
1. **Does it support the free tier Gemini API Key?**
    * The free tier only supports text generation, not image generation.
2. **503 Error or Retry Error during generation**
    * Check Docker internal logs as described in the README to locate the specific 503 error. This is usually caused by incorrect model configuration.
3. **Why is the API Key in .env not taking effect?**
    1. You need to restart Docker containers to apply changes to `.env`.
    2. If parameters were set in the web settings page, they override `.env`. You can use "Restore Default Settings" to revert to `.env` values.
4. **Garbled text on generated pages**
    * Try higher resolution output (OpenAI format might not support this).
    * Ensure the page description includes the specific text to be rendered.
